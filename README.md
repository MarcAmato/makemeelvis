Code from "Head First PHP & MySQL" tutorial.
This is a PHP web application for building and maintaining an email list. (!!! PHP mail() not working)

Can store data persietently in a MySQL database, and can also interact with that data through web forms.
A combination of HTML pages, PHP scripts, and embedded SQL queries allow user to add and remove customers too/from their email list,
as well as sending email messages to entire list (couldn't get this working with PHP mail() and hmailServer).
